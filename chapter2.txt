While as noted strict real world/virtual world splits do not hold up
under scrutiny, being online can feel quite different from being
offline, and there is little doubt that online experiences can change
people in many different ways. There are a variety of ways that these
changes have manifested, and great debate about how extensive these
changes really are. Fundout other
cultures and other ways of being (much of it provided by digital
media) can be deeply confusing and challenging to one’s identity,
especially among those in the still formative years of youth. Some
celebrate this condition as liberating us from overly rigid roles and
lifestyles, while others see this as a dangerous development whose
flip side is people desperately turning to religious or ideological
fundamentalisms, or disintegrating into aimlessness and moral
confusion. Social scientists (sociologists, cultural anthropologists,
psychologists) are deeply divided about the validity of such
claims. Some are quite skeptical that stable identities are less
common today than in earlier eras, and some doubt that stable
identities are necessary. What’s the truth? How much do real lives and
virtual lives differ? In what ways are digital cultures changing who
we are as individuals and as communities?
