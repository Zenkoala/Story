One of the most talked-about and studied questions about digital
culture is how similar or dissimilar our “online” identities are to
our “offline” ones. In this chapter I want to take up from a number of
different angles key linked issues surrounding efforts to make sense
of the relation between real life (RL) and digiAnonymity,
Disinhibition tized or virtual life (VL). These issues include people
disguising their identities online, changing ideas of personal privacy
brought about by a surveillance culture and revelatory social media,
similarities and differences between virtual communities and
traditional offline ones, online anonymity as it shapes how we talk to
each other, and questions around whether or not we are becoming more
like posthuman cyborgs (part person, part machine) as we become more
deeply entangled with digital devices.
