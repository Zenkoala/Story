These early insights about identity in cyberspaces continue to be very
important, though in less hyperbolic form. Identity crossdressing
remains a significant phenomenon in chat rooms, social media and
dating sites, and other online spaces. Rise of the slang term catfish
to describe someone who systematically lies about who they are online
testifies to this ongoing process. The popularity of the documentary
film “Catfish” (2010), and the spin-off reality TV docudrama “Catfish:
The TV Show” (2012+) in which participants uncover falsified
identities, has revived interest in the question of how much identity
trickery goes on online.
