Significant instances of identity-shifting phenomena, under concepts
like racial cross-dressing and identity tourism (Nakamura 2002),
continue and are actively studied. From relatively trivial forms like
cyber fibbing about one’s looks or job or age on online dating sites,
to more serious, even criminal, acts of impersonation, it is clear
that engaging with digital cultures can have an impact on
self-image. But as the term identity tourism suggests, merely touring
an identity is very different from profoundly inhabiting a body that
is frequently subjected to discrimination. Developing the deep
cultural competence to understand another person’s subject position
(subject position as the way your race, gender, language, class, etc.
position you in the world and unwittingly shape your world view) when
it differs significantly from your own in terms of ethnicity, class,
gender and so forth is not achieved by casual surfing or digital
masquerading.
